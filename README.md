# CACBarcode
Convert scanned CAC barcodes (PDF417 and Code39) into readable data.

The original Python Code that this repo was forked from and based off of was created by jkusner.

These program only work on the assumption you have scanned the barcode in and have the value, these codes do NOT handle the scanning process. Since most scanners act like keyboard input, you can typically use these programs with a scanner, but results may varry.
